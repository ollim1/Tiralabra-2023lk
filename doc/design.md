# Design

This project is done as a part of the Computer Science study program of University of Helsinki (TKT). In this project two algorithms will be implemented for compression rate comparisons.

The programming language of choice is C. In addition to this I can use Java, C++, Haskell and Python. The project documentation is written in English

The algorithms to be implemented are Huffman and Lempel-Ziv-Storer-Szymanski (LZSS).

## Data structures

## Input/Output

The program will use take input from binary or text files and stdin. The compression and decompression algorithms to be used may be specified through command line flags. At least output to stdout will be implemented.
